-- NAME:        NDR - Suspect web server enumeration (Discovery)
-- CATEGORY:    NDR
-- DESCRIPTION: Detection for finding instances of http webserver scanning or webcrawling. 
-- Default severity score is 3. 
--    If a known bad useragent is discovered from any of a variety of common crawling/enumeration tools, 3 points are added. 
--    The HttpPagesSample field is a random sample of all the distinct webpages that were requested. 
--    They are compared against a common webserver enumeration wordlist. 
--       If 25% of them match, 1 is added to the severity score. 
--       If 50%, 2 is added. 
--       If 75%, 3 is added. 
-- Max severity score is 9. If the score is 9 it is almost guaranteed to be a very suspicious webserver enumeration attempt.
